  <h1 class="maintitle"> Follow The Fibers </h1>
<p class="paragraph">
    Thinking about the function of the ankle and foot, we can appreciate all
    the work the foot and ankle do in walking but we don’t usually think about
    how a foot can affect the hip, or the spine or even the head. My objective
    is to illustrate and apply the principles to any part of the body. Let’s
    take a look at how a simple change in an ankle joint impacts us...
</p>
<p>
    When we look at the body, we can see that muscles have fibers and
    specifically, they have unique fiber direction that tells us everything we
    need to know about the muscle’s function. Structure and function
    relationship of muscles of muscles; the two ends of origin and insertion
    come together as a muscle contracts and approximates the two ends,
    typically with one end moving and the other acting as the anchor point.

<p>
    Surrounding the muscles (on the outside, within, and deep to the muscle) we
    have a structure called fascia – a <em>continuous</em> connective sheath
    that covers the entire body. It acts as a shock absorber for tensile
    forces, almost like a rubber band to help keep us upright and reduce the
    amount of muscular effort it takes to hold us in the right posture. In
    addition, within the fascia, we have artery, vein, nerve and lymphatic
    structures, contained. Fascial orientation is, for simplicity sake, is in a
    very similar direction of muscles. If we look at the structure, would make
    sense because as the muscle moves, the structures around the muscle will
    also move in that direction.
</p>
<p>
    But is that it? Let’s zoom out and look at the bigger picture! If we follow
    the direction of the fibers in <b>Figure 1</b>, we can see that the Achilles
    tendon continuous with the gastrocnemius and soleus, directed superiorly to
    the ankle, join the “hamstring” group. As the hamstrings flex the knee, and
    with the gluteal tissues extend the femur at the hip joint, we can see the
    Iliotibial tract <b>(Fig 2: tendon along the blue line)</b> sends mechanical pull
    towards the gluteal mass diagonally to the lumbosacral joint. From there,
    we can follow the direction of the thoracolumbar fascia, as it transitions
    through the latissimus dorsi, and the lower trapezius to the shoulder,
    diagonally. From the shoulder, the upper trapezius and deeper muscles of
    the shoulder, have fibers connecting forces back up the occiput. <b>Figure 3</b>
    gives an idea of fiber direction of ligaments of the spine from the occiput
    at the head going down spine inferiorly.
</p>
<p>
    The above is just one example of how forces can transfer from head to toe,
    and vice versa. If by chance, we see structural restriction in the ankle
    joint, where forces are not evenly dispersed, over time, we can develop
    improper force distribution that can manifest problems in areas that seem
    unrelated to the ankle such as lower back or even headaches if the forces
    reach the occiput. We can apply the same principles when we flex the body
    or extend the body and follow the directions of fibers and their
    relationships to understand where mechanical forces will travel.
</p>
<p>
    If we can balance the mechanical forces by allowing motion to be restored
    through the joints, we can re-establish proper blood flow not only to the
    area of the joint, but allow other joints along the way to move with
    greater ease and symmetry.
</p>
<p>
    In manual osteopathy, the goal is to find health where it is lost, by
    restoring proper motion of joints and structures and removing obstructions
    of nerve, artery, vein and lymphatics to the area of dysfunction. This
    allows allow the body’s innate self-healing and regulating mechanisms to
begin. You can use this information to focus on motion throughout not    <em>only</em> the troubled areas, but joints and structures that are
    connected to those areas.
