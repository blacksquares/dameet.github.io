 <h1 class="maintitle"> Musculoskeletal System and its Effect on the Organ System </h1>
  <h4 class="maintitle"> How does muscle and joint pain affect the viscera/organ system and an explanation of how communication occurs </h4><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an abnormal stimulus occurs, the sensory nerves goes from the skin or muscle <em>to</em> the spine to make it&rsquo;s way up to the brain where it then sends motor nerves to the structure to react to the abnormal stimulus in an attempt to correct it. This occurs subconsciously and countless times throughout the day. I want to explore how these structures will play a role on influencing your organs. Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>To better understand the concepts, it&rsquo;s important to view the spinal cord as a highway, let&rsquo;s say...the Gardiner Expressway or the 401. When the impulses enter or leave the spinal cord through the vertebral foramen, think of it as the entrance or exit ramp of the highway. When the nerve communicates with the structure itself, the branch of the nerve is like a street.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the abnormal sensory stimulus comes to the spine from the muscle or skin, it enters the entrance ramp, but this nerve isn&rsquo;t the only one that uses the road. Sharing that same road are nerves from the organs. From our experience, a problem with one vehicle on a road impacts the rest of the vehicles trying to accommodate around the problem. Similarly, when the nerve is irritated over a long period of time, the output going to the muscle or skin will also abnormally stimulate the nerve to the organs sharing that same output. When there is a problem on the exit ramp, you can expect a delay getting to the roads, or .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: let&rsquo;s imagine a person has a pelvis that has restriction in motion and thus the sacrum does not move the way it is intended. Person has tightness in the hamstrings and possibly in the gluteal muscles. Over time, this may affect the nerves of the sacrum such as pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4) which go to the pelvic organs, last 3<sup>rd</sup> of the large intestine and rectum affecting proper elimination of waste products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, changes in your musculoskeletal system will have an affect on your organs and vice versa!</p>
